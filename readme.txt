Adds a one click "Unpublish" button to the WordPress edit screen; switches the status to pending.

== Description ==

Unpublish is a very simple plugin that does one simple thing: it adds a button to the Edit Post screen.

This button will appear on published posts/pages/etc, which on click will save the post as pending rather than keeping it published.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of `unpublish.tar.gz` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Usage Documentation ==

Click the button if you no longer want the post published.

== Changelog ==
